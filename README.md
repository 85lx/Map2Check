<b>Goal:</b> 
<p align="justify">
     This tool aims to automate the Map2Check method that aims to automatically generate and 
     verify memory management test cases for unit tests, which are based on assertions extracted 
     from safety properties generated by BMC tools. In particular, the proposed method checks for 
     properties related to pointer safety, memory leaks, and invalid free. Map2Check adopts 
     the ESBMC model checker and the CUnit testing framework.

configure.sh script from inside the directory where Map2Check was extracted.
</p>

> Example: <br>
> 1) $ cd Map2Check-Fortes_vx <br>
> 2) $ ls <br>
>    code_samples  <configure.py>  <map2check-fortes.py>  modules  README  result_claims <br>
> 3) $ sudo ./configure.py <br>

It is advisable that you should set the environment variable PATH in your .bashrc file as follows:

> $ export PATH=$PATH:/home/user/Map2Check_vx/

- <b>STEP 4:</b>

Testing Map2Check

> $ map2check-fortes.py code_samples/D_CBMC_bound_array.c 

The output is the new code and the binary program in  code_samples/
